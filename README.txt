Hey friends, this is my internship project. TREND is used to store hardware specifications and forensic processing to be used in litigation processes.
Tracking Evidence Network Database, TREND, was a prototype created by Mike Sewell of Convergence Data Force/Calvin Weeks & Associates, LLC. 
TREND is currently in development, but not for much longer. 
Many thanks to my personal mentor on this project, Jesse Harlin <@5imian>, for all your efforts to teach me best practices through this project.

I am making a small edit in this readme file as a test.
